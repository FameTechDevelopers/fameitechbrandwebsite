                  FAMEITECH operates with a 48â€“72-hour turnaround time for most
                  design services. This duration refers to a single iteration of
                  a design stage and does not encompass the entire project
                  timeline. The time required for revisions may range from 48 to
                  72 hours, equivalent to two working days. Orders or revisions
                  placed on a Monday will be delivered by Wednesday, while those
                  on a Friday will be delivered by the end of Tuesday.
